I'm proud to share one of my technical achievements! I have developed an innovative device that detects gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) in the surrounding environment.  
🔍 **Device Features:**  
- Accurately monitors gas levels.  
- Automatically triggers an alarm when levels exceed safe limits.  

🎯 **Project Goal:** Contributing to improving environmental safety and protecting lives from the dangers of gas poisoning.  

I look forward to hearing your feedback and thoughts on the project!
